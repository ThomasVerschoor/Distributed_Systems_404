1) TCP connection of replication start get reopened for every file: lot of threads created
    Fix?: Make server send "ACK" back so client can send next file.

2) Clients amount of nodes does not get updated when node leaves
    Fix?: let the exit be multicast from client so other nodes can detect it [BETTER]
    Fix?: let server send out a unicast to every node letting it know it needs to delete a node.

3) Failure handler for clients not yet implemented.
    Fix:? Implement it lol

4) Http and TCP/UDP IP's from packets are different!
    Fix:? choose one protocols IP and set in map, use map IP's for the rest
    Fixed! Did the above.

5) When multiple nodes are added artificially in YServer when node sends exit it resets count to 0
    Fix:? I dunno
    Fixed! all IP's were the same, Nodes get removed based on IP...
